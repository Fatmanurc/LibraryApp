# LibraryApp - Windows Forms Library Management System

This is a C# Windows Forms application designed for managing a small library system. 
It includes separate panels for personnel and users, login functionality, and book registration features.

## Features

- User and Personnel login
- User and Personnel panels with different permissions
- Book registration and management
- GUI-based interactions with Windows Forms

## Database

This project uses a **MySQL** database for storing user, personnel, and book data.
**Important**  
> The SQL file (`LibraryAppDB.sql`) does **not** create the database itself.  
> You must manually create a database named `libraryapp` before running the script.
